* ``webpage`` module to be used for interacting with frontend

Conduit: a natural or artificial channel through which something (such as a fluid) is conveyed

"Conduit" seems to encapsulate the idea of a channel facilitating communication.
It's a single word, easy to remember, and technically appropriate.
It also doesn't tie the name to a specific technology, allowing for potential changes in the underlying protocol without renaming the package.
