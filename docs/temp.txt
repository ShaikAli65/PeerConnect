working of application:

we are using an IPC thing with frontend and backend

backend has a websocket server endpoint running, and when application starts up, it opens index.html in PeerConnect/webpage directory using a http server or a simple webbrowser.open call

now frontend connects to predefined websocket endpoint running at localhost, (port numbers are hardcoded into source)

after connection of webpage, python further boots up the application

now if any of the core code or application feature code needs to interact with frontend, it uses functions provided by webpage_handlers.webpage module

and all the frontend communication part is inside webpage_handlers package, so that we can seperate frontend comms in a clear way
while testing we can even mock all the webpage_handlers package and automate user interactions

we are using a custom json schema for back-and-fourth communication
